The **missionaries and cannibals** problem is usually stated as follows. Three missionaries
and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or
two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group of missionaries
in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. This problem is famous in
AI because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem formulation from an
analytical viewpoint (Amarel, 1968).
